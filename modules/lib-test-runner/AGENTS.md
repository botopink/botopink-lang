Package that builds the `botopink-lib-test` executable: the CI gate that runs
every discovered project's test suite on each requested backend and aggregates
the results into a lib×target matrix. Projects are discovered across the resolved
**root list** (`resolveRoots`: bundled `repository/botopink-lang/libs`, sibling
`repository/`, legacy flat `libs/`, de-duped nearest-first; first-root-wins by
name). It **shells out to the installed `botopink` binary** (`botopink test
--target <t>` with `cwd` set to each lib's own directory) and touches no compiler
internals — so it carries **no `compiler-core` dependency**. Its job is discovery
+ fan-out + aggregation + exit code, nothing the compiler already does.

## Commands

```bash
# from the workspace root:
zig build test-libs                                   # every lib, commonJS+erlang
zig build test-libs -- --target erlang --lib rakun    # one target, one lib
zig build test-libs -- --target all --strict          # supported targets, strict

# from this package:
zig build               # produce ./zig-out/bin/botopink-lib-test
zig build test          # arg-parsing + discovery + matrix unit tests
```

## CLI surface

```
botopink-lib-test [--target <t>[,<t>…] | --target all] [--lib <name>]
                  [--filter <s>] [--strict] [--bin <path>]
```

- `--target` — repeatable / comma-separated. Accepts `commonJS|erlang|beam|wasm`
  plus the alias `node`→`commonJS`, and both `--target <t>` and `--target=<t>`.
  Default: `commonJS,erlang`. `all` expands to every *supported* target.
- `--lib <name>` — restrict to one project by name across roots (default: every
  project with a `botopink.json`).
- `--filter <s>` — forwarded to `botopink test --filter`.
- `--strict` — treat an unsupported target (beam/wasm) as a **failure** instead of
  a skip (default: skip with `~`, keeping the gate green until those backends run).
- `--bin <path>` — `botopink` binary path. Also read from `BOTOPINK_BIN`; defaults
  to `./zig-out/bin/botopink`, else the bare name `botopink` on `PATH`.

## Matrix legend & exit code

| Symbol | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `✓` | `botopink test` passed |
| `✗` | a red `.bp` test — the **only** status that fails the run |
| `–` | lib has no test blocks (green skip, never a failure) |
| `~` | target not yet runnable (beam/wasm), skipped unless `--strict` |

**Exit non-zero iff at least one cell is `✗`.** A no-tests lib (`–`) and a
skipped-unsupported target (`~`) never redden the gate.

## Design contract

- **Orchestrate, don't reimplement.** Per-lib isolation falls out of spawning a
  child with `cwd = <lib_dir>` (the lib's own directory, under any resolved root):
  `botopink test` reads that lib's `botopink.json` and writes its own
  `.botopinkbuild/test-out/`. No global-cwd juggling.
- **Unsupported-target detection is child-driven**, not a hard-coded list: the
  runner scans the child's output for `"currently supports only"`. The moment
  `botopink test` learns `beam`/`wasm`, that target stops being skipped here with
  no change — only the default/`all` set widens (`args.Target.supported`).
- **No lib coupling, no core code.** The runner names no specific lib and imports
  nothing from `compiler-core`.
